# Virtual-Assistant
This virtual assistant is designed to perform various tasks for you through voice commands. However, it currently works only on specific browsers: Google Chrome, Opera, and Microsoft Edge. Unfortunately, it does not support Safari or Firefox at the moment. Here's what it can do:

    Tell you the current time – Simply ask, and it will provide you with the time.

    Wish you accordingly – It can greet you based on the time of day, such as "Good morning," "Good afternoon," or "Good evening."

    Open applications on your Windows system – Just command it to open any application, and it will do so for you.

    Search the web – If you want to search for something on Google or any other platform, it can perform the search for you.

    Execute tasks via voice commands – All you need to do is give a voice command, and the assistant will handle the rest.

This project is a small yet practical exercise in web development, aimed at creating a functional and user-friendly virtual assistant. While it currently has limitations in browser compatibility, your feedback and appreciation would be greatly valued!
